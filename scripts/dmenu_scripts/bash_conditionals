-a file                          True if file exists.

-b file                          True if file exists and is a block special file.

-c file                          True if file exists and is a character special file.

-d file                          True if file exists and is a directory.

-e file                          True if file exists.

-f file                          True if file exists and is a regular file.

-g file                          True if file exists and its set-group-id bit is set.

-h file                          True if file exists and is a symbolic link.

-k file                          True if file exists and its "sticky" bit is set.

-p file                          True if file exists and is a named pipe (FIFO).

-r file                          True if file exists and is readable.

-s file                          True if file exists and has a size greater than zero.

-t fd                            True if file descriptor fd is open and refers to a terminal.

-u file                          True if file exists and its set-user-id bit is set.

-w file                          True if file exists and is writable.

-x file                          True if file exists and is executable.

-G file                          True if file exists and is owned by the effective group id.

-L file                          True if file exists and is a symbolic link.

-N file                          True if file exists and has been modified since it was last read.

-O file                          True if file exists and is owned by the effective user id.

-S file                          True if file exists and is a socket.

file1 -ef file2                  True if file1 and file2 refer to the same device and inode numbers.

file1 -nt file2                  True if file1 is newer (according to modification date) than file2, or if file1 exists and file2 does not.

file1 -ot file2                  True if file1 is older than file2, or if file2 exists and file1 does not.

-o optname                       True if the shell option optname is enabled. The list of options appears in the description of the -o option to the set builtin (see The Set Builtin).

-v varname                       True if the shell variable varname is set (has been assigned a value).

-R varname                       True if the shell variable varname is set and is a name reference.

-z string                        True if the length of string is zero.

-n string string                 True if the length of string is non-zero.

string1 == string2,              True if the strings are equal. When used with the [[ command, this performs pattern matching as described above (see Conditional Constructs). 
string1 = string2                ‘=’ should be used with the test command for POSIX conformance.

string1 != string2               True if the strings are not equal.

string1 < string2                True if string1 sorts before string2 lexicographically.

string1 > string2                True if string1 sorts after string2 lexicographically.

arg1 OP arg2, OP is one of ‘-eq’, ‘-ne’, ‘-lt’, ‘-le’, ‘-gt’, or ‘-ge’. '
